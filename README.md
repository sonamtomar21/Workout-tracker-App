# Workout-tracker-App
The Workout Tracker App is a JavaScript-based web application that lets users log running and cycling workouts directly on an interactive map using Leaflet.js. It uses geolocation, OOP, and localStorage to deliver a smooth, real-time tracking experience. This project strengthened my frontend skills and understanding of clean code structure.
This project demonstrates:
- Clean code architecture (Object-Oriented JavaScript)
- Geolocation API usage
- Interactive maps (Leaflet.js)
- Form handling and UI dynamic updates
- Data persistence using localStorage
- Responsive and modern UI design

Features
Click anywhere on the map to choose a workout location  
- A form pops up  
- Choose Running or Cycling
